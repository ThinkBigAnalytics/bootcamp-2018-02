**DATA SCIENCE SCENARIO :  CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES**

An international government contractor, working under contract for a US-based intelligence agency chartered with US national security, needs to conduct a study to help the agency focus resources on identifying and thwarting sources of crime in the world.  There is a strong belief that correlative patterns in many locales could amplify and enable criminal syndicate activities in the United States, the United Kingdom, the EU, and western economies in general.  In order to better plan their global investigations and investments over the next 10 years, the agency need to pinpoint areas to deploy undercover agents, recruit informants, and insert top-secret data gathering technologies.  While many sources for data for criminal  activities currently exist, the contractor requires an investigation that will identify relationship networks, potential causes, consequences, and correlates that enable and feed criminal activities.    The study should answer the following questions:

Key Questions:

- In the aggregate, which areas or regions in the world are sources for the greatest amount of criminal activities?  What is the basis for ranking?
- Is it possible, using public information, to identify and map crime-enabling relationship networks on a governmental, organizational, or individual level?
- Is it possible to find correlative patterns associated with criminal activites?
- Is it possible to predict crime levels or patterns in a given locale given correlates?
- To achieve optimal results (with focus on ROI), which nations, networks, or correlates should be addressed first?

In addition to the many data sets referenced on the Quality of Government site ( [http://qog.pol.gu.se/](http://qog.pol.gu.se/)), the investigation should also identify and cite at least 3 additional data sources, and  determine the current and projected costs, if any, for on-going data acquisitions costs.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR DATA

**P.C. Labs**

The government contractor in question does business globally under the name P. C. Labs ( **Project Cadmus Labs** ), a secretive organization that specializes in genetic engineering and high technology surveillance.  Little is known of the secretive organization, other than it is private, allegedly has been involved with a laundry list of governmental agencies including the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the Torchwood Institute, MI6, and Europol.



**CEO:  Professor Dabney Donovan**

The CEO of P.C. Labs, **Professor Dabney Donovan** , is a proponent of genetic engineering without limits and sometimes uses P.C. Labs in tandem with intelligence agency projects to further his own goals.  He is not a proponent of Data Science solutions and typically invests in human enhancement protocals and survellience assets and technologies.

There is a component of the contract in question that requires P.C.Labs to provide a preliminary study of the plausibility of using public data sources to identify correlates to crime and even create useful predictive models if possible.  Donovan does not believe the study is useful and has only agreed to the subcontract in order to do other work under the contract which is more in line with his interests.

**Head of Labs: Don Snow**

Don Snow was seconded to Cadmus labs in April 2015, and since then works with Cadmus as an external consultant, now in the lead on P.C.Labs internal &quot;Safety Everywhere&quot; program. Don leads a small team of security analysts and works on matters of high priority for national security. His background is in computer science, software engineering, information retrieval, database engineering, statistics, application management and software security.

A direct subordinate of  Professor Donovan, Snow merged into the Professor&#39;s direct analyst team for the previous 6 months, even though Snow still maintains direct relationships with many NSA elements outside of the Cadmus hierarchy. Don and the Professor do not have a good management relationship and do not communicate effectively.

Snow runs an internal team of data analysts operating from the P.C.Labs Cheyanne Mountain complex who have access to much more sensitive crime information and generate internal security products for other analysts, assets, and policy makers. His team needs more people to build these large-scale open-source projects.   If successful Think Big will support Snow&#39;s team directly and perhaps open up other avenues for further sensitive contracts. It is likely that P.C.Labs will security vet the team and bring them into the organization for around 6 months before any project can begin. _According to Don_, Don&#39;s opinion matters in qualifying the technical capabilities of Think Big to begin the process of accepting them as a contractor.
